      <p>I'm a UX Researcher with a PhD in Experimental Psychology. I apply mixed methods research to connect decision makers and end users through data-driven storytelling.<br><br>
      I started my career in clinical research, and while I loved delving into complex quantitative methods to understand behavioral and biological profiles of traumatic brain injury, aging, and learning disabilities, I realized I most enjoyed deeply listening to people's stories and working together to create behavioral change.<br><br>
       When I got my first taste of product design through a collaboration with engineering students working on a mobile health app, I loved seeing my work take shape and drive immediate impact at scale. That's when I knew I wanted to pursue a career in UX research, where I could leverage insights about human behavior to create better experiences. <br><br>
       Outside of work, I'm a national parks enthusiast, pickleball champion, non-stop knitter, and mom to a yellow lab.
