# My Story

I'm a UX Researcher with a PhD in Experimental Psychology. I apply mixed methods research to connect decision makers and end users through data-driven storytelling.

I started my career in clinical research, and while I loved delving into complex quantitative neuropsychological methods, I realized I most enjoyed deeply listening to people's stories and working together to create behavioral change. When I got my first taste of product design through a collaboration with engineering students working on a mobile health app, I loved seeing my work take shape and drive immediate impact at scale. That's when I knew I wanted to pursue a career in UX research, where I could leverage insights about human behavior to create better experiences. 

Outside of work, I'm a national parks enthusiast, pickleball champion, non-stop knitter, and mom to a yellow lab. You can also find me at [RVA Design Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rvadsgn/) or [Ladies that UX Richmond](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ladies-that-ux-richmond/).
