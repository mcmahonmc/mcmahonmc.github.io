      <p>I'm a UX Researcher with a PhD in Experimental Psychology. I apply mixed methods research to connect decision makers and end users through data-driven storytelling.<br><br>
      <h2>My Story</h2>
      My professional journey began in the realm of clinical research, where I explored the intricate behavioral and biological profiles of traumatic brain injury, aging, and learning disabilities. While I thrived on the quantitative rigor, my true calling emerged from the powerful stories of individuals navigating these challenges. I discovered a deep passion for listening and collaborating to drive meaningful behavioral change.<br><br>
      When I got my first taste of product design through a collaboration with engineering students working on a mobile health app, I loved seeing my work take shape and drive immediate impact at scale. That's when I knew I wanted to pursue a career in UX research, where I could leverage insights about human behavior to create better experiences. </p>
      <h2>How I work</h2>
      <p>I utilize a blend of qualitative and quantitative research methods to bridge the gap between end-users and decision-makers. From in-depth interviews and diary studies to large-scale surveys and usability testing, I craft comprehensive research strategies that uncover nuanced insights and drive actionable outcomes.<br><br>
      My approach is holistic and collaborative. I believe in the power of interdisciplinary teamwork and regularly engage stakeholders across product, design, and engineering to ensure that our solutions are not only user-friendly but also feasible and impactful.</p>
