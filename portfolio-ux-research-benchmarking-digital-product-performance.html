                                        <h2>Challenge</h2>

                                        <p>As Mercari prepared to roll out three major product features in 2023, the team lacked a structured approach to track how these changes would impact user experience and business performance over time. Without this, we risked making decisions without fully understanding user satisfaction or identifying functionality issues that could arise as the platform evolved.</p>

                                        <h2>Objective</h2>

                                        <p>Develop a comprehensive benchmarking system to monitor key UX metrics over time, enabling Mercari to make data-driven, user-centered decisions.</p>
                                        
                                        <h2>My Role</h2>

                                        <p>As the UX Researcher and project lead, I was responsible for study design, research strategy, stakeholder collaboration, data visualization, and training and enablement.</p>

                                        <h2>Problem</h2>

                                        <p>Mercari’s UX was evolving rapidly, but there was no reliable way to measure how each new feature affected the overall user experience. This left the team without insights into user satisfaction, ease of navigation, or product usability across different segments. Additionally, there was strong interest in understanding Mercari's performance relative to key competitors, such as eBay and Depop.</p>

                                        <h2>Core Question</h2>

                                        <blockquote>
                                            <p>How can we create a system that reliably tracks user experience, identifies usability issues, and informs product decisions across multiple launches?</p>
                                        </blockquote>

                                        <h2>Vision</h2>

                                        <p>Our vision was to create a scalable UX benchmarking system that would:

                                                <li>Track key UX metrics over time to detect changes in usability and user satisfaction.</li>
                                                <li>Allow comparisons with competitors to understand market positioning.</li>
                                                <li>Provide actionable insights to inform product strategy and feature prioritization.</li>

                                        <h4>Stakeholder Interviews</h4>

                                        <p>To ensure the benchmarking system met organizational needs, I conducted interviews and team discussions with key stakeholders, including product managers, UX designers, and data engineers. The main takeaways were:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Interest in a lightweight, consistent approach that could be adapted across product releases.</li>
                                                <li>A preference for metrics like ease of use, community engagement, and task efficiency.</li>
                                                <li>Agreement to benchmark against eBay consistently, with flexibility to alternate other competitors (e.g., Depop or WhatNot) based on market relevance.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>

                                        <p>The study plan outlined three primary goals:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Measure alignment with company objectives and UX values.</li>
                                                <li>Compare user engagement and satisfaction with competitors.</li>
                                                <li>Track performance of key product areas, such as listing, community, and onboarding, over time​.</li>

                                        <b>Key Task Identification</b>

                                        <p>In collaboration with UX designers, we identified critical user tasks to focus on, such as listing items, browsing, and checkout. This selection was guided by internal metrics and team input on areas with the highest impact potential.</p>

                                        <b>Journey Mapping</b>

                                        <p>I leveraged user journey maps for each task to understand pain points and potential friction areas. This mapping allowed us to design survey questions that targeted each stage of the user journey, from onboarding to post-purchase engagement, ensuring the benchmarking system captured comprehensive user feedback.</p>

We incorporated elements from the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Google HEART framework to provide standardized, comparable metrics. This addition helped align our metrics with industry benchmarks and gave us insights into areas like user satisfaction and engagement​</p>

                                        <p>I used a sampling strategy targeting users who accessed Mercari within the last week, ensuring we reached an active user base. The surveys were delivered via Sprig, and incentives like gift card sweepstakes were offered to encourage participation and improve data quality.

                                        <b>Looker Dashboard Development</b>

                                        <p>I collaborated with data engineers to set up a pipeline to ingest Sprig data into Looker. I created the Looker dashboards that displayed real-time data from the surveys. These dashboards allowed stakeholders across the organization to track trends in user sentiment, identify pain points, and compare Mercari’s performance against competitors in real-time.</p>

Targeted improvements to the search interface resulted in a +13% increase in order volume in previously underperforming categories.
