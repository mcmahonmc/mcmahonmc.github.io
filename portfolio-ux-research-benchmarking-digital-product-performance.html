                                <p>As Mercari prepared to roll out multiple product features in 2023, the team lacked a consistent framework to track how these updates impacted user experience and overall business performance over time. This posed a risk—decisions were being made without fully understanding user satisfaction or identifying functionality gaps that might hinder adoption. The growing need for a clear and scalable system became critical to ensuring that product changes were grounded in real user feedback and would drive meaningful improvements.</p>

                                        <p>To ensure the benchmarking system would meet organizational needs, I conducted interviews and discussions with key stakeholders, including product managers, UX designers, and data engineers. The team expressed a desire for a lightweight, adaptable system that could be used across various product releases, focusing on metrics like ease of use, community engagement, and task efficiency. Stakeholders also agreed to benchmark consistently against eBay, with flexibility to incorporate other competitors as market relevance shifted.</p>

                                        <p>I led discussions with our research team to identify key tasks based off prior journey mapping studies. Together, we decided on listing items, browsing, and checkout. Journey mapping allowed us to pinpoint pain points at each stage of user interaction, helping us design survey questions that captured feedback across the entire user journey—from onboarding to post-purchase engagement.</p>

                                        <h3>Survey Design</h3>

                                        <p>We developed surveys that blended standardized metrics (like the System Usability Scale and Google HEART framework) with Mercari-specific questions. This approach provided a mix of industry-standard insights and tailored feedback that helped align our data with business goals.</p>

                                        <h4>Recruitment & Sampling Strategy</h4>

                                        <p>Using a targeted sampling strategy, I ensured we gathered feedback from users who had recently interacted with Mercari. The surveys were deployed via Sprig, with incentives like gift card sweepstakes offered to improve data quality and boost participation.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Looker Dashboard Development</h4>

                                        <p>I worked closely with data engineers to set up a pipeline that ingested survey data into Looker. I designed dashboards that provided real-time insights on user sentiment, pain points, and allowed for competitor comparisons. These dashboards made it easier for stakeholders across teams to access and analyze data in real time, facilitating better, user-informed decision-making.</p>

                                                <li><b>Improved search functionality. </b>Insights from the benchmarking process revealed search functionality as a major pain point. Focused improvements to the search interface led to a +13% increase in order volume in underperforming categories.</li>
                                                <li><b>Enhanced product insights. </b>The Looker dashboards democratized UX data, making it accessible to product managers, designers, and engineers. This led to more informed, user-centered product decisions and cross-functional collaboration.</li>
                                                <li><b>Growth in team analytics skills. </b> I conducted training sessions to help the team become proficient in using the dashboards, fostering a culture of data-driven insights within the UX department.</li>

                                        <h2>Reflection & Learnings</h2>

                                        <p>One of the most valuable—and challenging—experiences in this project was navigating the integration of AI-coded open-text responses. Initially, using AI to surface key insights from open-ended survey questions provided valuable qualitative feedback, but it soon became clear that this data needed careful handling beyond our immediate team. Questions around how this data would be interpreted and used surfaced, particularly in ensuring accuracy, mitigating bias, and safeguarding privacy when used across various business functions. Additionally, integrating this data into Looker proved difficult due to limitations in how our survey data was formatted. The system wasn’t well-suited to managing AI-generated responses in a way that allowed for longitudinal trend analysis. As a result, visualizing findings over time required creative workarounds—leveraging manual adjustments to dashboards and building custom reporting methods that could capture long-term user behavior changes.</p>

                                        <p>Another key learning involved developing a systematic approach for UX performance tracking. Tracking UX across multiple product features meant not just collecting data, but ensuring that it could handle directional swings—fluctuations in user satisfaction or usability over time due to various internal and external factors. This became a balancing act, requiring rigorous testing to ensure our system remained robust and adaptable while providing actionable insights. It was clear that a flexible and scalable solution was essential, one that could accommodate shifts in user engagement patterns without losing sight of long-term trends. Achieving this level of robustness wasn’t something that could be done in isolation—it required close collaboration with product managers, data engineers, and UX designers, all of whom brought different perspectives and expertise to the table.</p>

                                        <p>The development of this UX performance tracking system also highlighted the importance of cross-functional teamwork. With each milestone, we leaned heavily on thought partnership to bridge gaps between design, research, and data engineering. I learned that aligning objectives across departments early in the process was key to avoiding misalignment later, especially when data-driven insights had to inform real-time product decisions. Building shared accountability for the system’s success, rather than siloed ownership, fostered stronger collaboration and enabled better feedback loops—something that ultimately strengthened the system's long-term impact.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Ultimately, this project underscored the power of a well-integrated UX benchmarking framework: not only does it serve as a tool to measure success, but it also lays the groundwork for more collaborative and effective product development. Through this experience, I gained deeper insights into the intricacies of tracking UX performance over time, and I’m excited to apply these learnings in future projects where robust, scalable UX solutions are critical to business success.</p>
