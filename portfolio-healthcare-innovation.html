                                <h1>Transforming Emergency Department Experiences for Rural Hospitals</h1>

                                <p>In rural hospital emergency departments, long wait times are a common challenge that lead to patient frustration, dissatisfaction, and, often, patients leaving without receiving care. This case study details a research initiative aimed at improving the waiting experience for patients, enhancing communication, and making care feel more accessible. Through field studies, empathy interviews, and journey mapping, we uncovered key pain points in the ED environment and identified creative strategies to transform these experiences. By focusing on systems thinking, collaboration, and low-cost interventions, this project resulted in measurable improvements in patient satisfaction, highlighting how simple yet effective changes can drive lasting impact in rural healthcare settings.

                                        <h2>Challenge</h2>

                                        <p>At two of VCU Health's rural community hospitals, long wait times in the emergency departments were a persistent issue, driven by limited resources and high patient volumes. Both hospitals had started implementing daily huddles that included tracking leave-without-being-seen (LWBS) metrics, but these efforts were falling short in creating lasting improvements. Hospital leadership recognized the need for additional momentum to meaningfully transform the patient experience. They sought our team’s expertise to uncover new strategies that would build upon their current initiatives and address patient frustration while improving communication and satisfaction during prolonged waits.</p>

                                        <h2>The Research Process</h2>

                                        <p>To develop a shared understanding of the problem space, our team conducted field studies, empathy interviews, and journey mapping to capture the needs and pain points of both patients and hospital staff. I collaborated closely with healthcare providers, conducted observation studies in waiting rooms, and developed storyboards based on key moments in the patient journey. Additionally, I used tools like Miro for co-synthesis and affinity mapping to identify key insights that could shape future interventions. Later, VCU students prepared prototypes of the top concepts emerging from the ideation workshop, which were displayed in the emergency department waiting rooms and staff areas for feedback.</p>

                                        <p>We worked with students to synthesize findings from interviews and observation studies, ultimately arriving at three key insights. First, patients felt “forgotten” during long waits, lacking regular updates on delays or expected treatment times. Second, communication gaps between staff and patients increased stress and frustration, leaving patients feeling neglected. Finally, brief interactions—such as periodic check-ins—could significantly improve care perception by reducing anxiety and building trust.</p>

                                        <h2>The Results</h2>

                                        <p>The collaborative effort between hospital staff, leadership, and VCU students resulted in tangible improvements to the patient experience in the ED. Simple interventions, like periodic check-ins and improved communication strategies, led to measurable increases in patient satisfaction. These strategies helped build trust, reduced perceived wait times, and made patients feel more cared for during their visits.</p>

                                        <p>Hospital leadership also embraced a human-centered approach, focusing on understanding the “jobs to be done” by their patients, rather than relying solely on assumptions. This shift created a culture of innovation, with hospital teams actively collaborating to drive ongoing improvements.</p>

                                        <h2>The VCU Student Experience</h2>

                                        <p>As part of this project, I co-taught the course “Designing the Future of Health” at VCU, which empowered students to tackle real-world challenges in rural health systems using design thinking. The course gave students hands-on experience in conducting field research, empathy interviews, and journey mapping, all while working alongside healthcare providers and hospital staff.</p>

                                        <p>For their midterm presentations, students were understandably anxious about presenting to senior hospital leadership. This was their first time engaging with such a formal process, and most had little prior experience in healthcare or with the VCU Health System. However, these presentations turned into an incredible networking opportunity for the students, as they had the chance to share their research findings and opportunity statements directly with hospital administrators and senior leaders. The feedback they received not only validated their work but also opened doors for future collaboration.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>At the end of the semester, we hosted a virtual demo day where students showcased their top ideas through engaging pitches. These presentations allowed students to demonstrate their creative thinking and problem-solving skills, leading to excitement from hospital staff about potential solutions moving forward.</p>

                                                <li><b>Reliability of Student Deliverables. </b> It was difficult relying on students for consistent and timely deliverables, especially since it was their first time engaging with this process, and many had no prior experience in healthcare or with the VCU Health System.</li>
                                                <li><b>Limited Patient Representation. </b>We were dependent on staff and provider engagement for collecting patient feedback, and despite our best efforts, we struggled to gain sufficient patient input to fully represent their experiences.</li>
                                                <li><b>Implementation Delays. </b>We never got to implement the proposed solutions, although we did see considerable reductions in LWBS metrics. The feedback from providers, staff, and leadership about improved team morale was highly positive.</li>

                                        <h2>Looking Back</h2>

                                        <p>This project highlighted the power of empathy-driven, design thinking approaches to solving real-world healthcare challenges. It taught me valuable lessons in navigating resource constraints, fostering collaboration across teams, and using insights to advocate for meaningful change in healthcare. Even though we didn’t fully implement our solutions, the process brought fresh ideas, promoted communication, raised important issues for discussion, and improved morale among staff. By simply drawing more attention to the problem, we achieved real, measurable improvements in LWBS metrics—an outcome that made this project a success in its own right.</p>

                                        <p>On a personal level, this project reinforced the power of design thinking to bring diverse perspectives together to solve complex problems. Working alongside students who had no prior experience in healthcare allowed me to refine my facilitation skills and think creatively about how to bridge gaps between research, real-world application, and systemic change.</p>
