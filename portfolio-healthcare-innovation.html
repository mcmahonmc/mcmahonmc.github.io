                                        <h2>Challenge</h2>

                                        <p>In rural hospital emergency departments, long wait times are common due to limited resources and high patient volumes. This often leads to frustration and dissatisfaction among patients, with many leaving without receiving care. Our goal was to transform the waiting experience to make patients feel more cared for and reduce their perception of the wait.</p>

                                        <h2>Our Goal</h2>

                                        <p>To redesign the waiting experience in the emergency department by improving communication and comfort, ultimately reducing patient frustration and enhancing satisfaction.</p>
                                        
                                        <h2>My Role</h2>

                                        <p>
                                            As the Health Innovation Lab’s Research Lead, I conducted field studies, empathy interviews, and journey mapping sessions to capture the needs of patients and staff. I also co-instructed a course, Designing the Future of Health, which empowered students to address these real-world challenges in rural health systems through systems thinking and design innovation.

                                        <p>Rural emergency departments face significant challenges in patient satisfaction due to long and sometimes unpredictable wait times. While medical attention was prioritized based on urgency, from empathy interviews and observation, we learned that communication gaps left patients feeling neglected, adding to frustration and prompting some to leave prematurely.

                                                <p>I wrote the discussion guides for my team and our students to interview healthcare providers, staff, and leadership who worked in or interfaced with the emergency departments. The goal of this was to understand what other factors might be contributing to patient wait times or poor patient experiences when visiting the ED.</p>

                                                <p>Through observation studies in the waiting rooms, we learned that patients often felt "forgotten" during their wait, with limited information about delays or expected treatment times.

                                        </blockquote>

                                        <p>In the next phase, students brainstormed together with healthcare providers, staff, and leadership, encouraging a collaborative approach to generating potential solutions. Through ideation workshops we focused on brainstorming practical, low-cost interventions that address the systemic issues uncovered during the research phase. Ideas ranged from improving communication between staff and patients to developing new digital tools for tracking patient flow.</p>

                                        <h2>Prototyping and Iterative Testing</h2>

                                        <p>With ideas in hand, students develop prototypes that are tested and refined in collaboration with hospital staff. This hands-on process allows students to iterate based on feedback and real-world use. Solutions are designed to be implementable within the constraints of rural healthcare, ensuring that they are scalable and sustainable over time.

                                        <p>This project highlighted the power of small, empathy-driven changes in healthcare design. By addressing patients' emotional needs and improving communication, we transformed the waiting experience, making patients feel valued and cared for even during long waits.
