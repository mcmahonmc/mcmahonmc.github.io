                                <h1>Reducing Patient Walk-Outs in Rural Emergency Departments</h1>

                                <p>In rural hospital emergency departments, long wait times are a common challenge that lead to patient frustration, dissatisfaction, and, often, patients leaving without receiving care. This case study details a research initiative aimed at improving the waiting experience for patients, enhancing communication, and making care feel more accessible. Through field studies, empathy interviews, and journey mapping, we uncovered key pain points in the emergency department environment and identified creative strategies to transform these experiences. By focusing on systems thinking, collaboration, and low-cost interventions, this project resulted in measurable improvements in patient satisfaction, highlighting how simple yet effective changes can drive lasting impact in rural healthcare settings.

                                        <p>At two of VCU Health's rural community hospitals, long wait times in emergency departments led to increased patient frustration and a high rate of patients leaving without being seen. Hospital leadership was invested in sharing patient outcomes data and feedback through daily huddles but struggled to create lasting improvements in patient experience. My role was to lead the research efforts to uncover patient and staff pain points, analyze systemic inefficiencies, and design actionable solutions to improve communication and perceived wait times.</p>

                                                <li><b>Field observations. </b>Conducted in-person observations in emergency department waiting rooms, analyzing staff-patient interactions, environmental stressors, and bottlenecks in the care process.</li>
                                                <li><b>Semi-structured interviews. </b>Designed, helped facilitate, and analyzed, 18 interviews with a diverse set of stakeholders—including emergency techs, nurses, physicians, and hospital presidents—to understand their perspectives on operational challenges and communication breakdowns. Crafting interview guides for this broad range of roles was particularly challenging, requiring careful adaptation of questions to uncover relevant insights across all levels of hospital leadership.</li>
                                                <li><b>Survey design & analysis. </b>Developed and administered surveys for staff and providers to assess perceptions of design challenges and prototype concepts.</li>

                                        <p>As part of this project, I co-taught the course “Designing the Future of Health” at VCU, which empowered students to tackle real-world challenges in rural health systems using design thinking. The course gave students hands-on experience in conducting field research, empathy interviews, and journey mapping, all while working alongside healthcare providers and hospital staff.</p>

                                        <p>For their midterm presentations, students were understandably anxious about presenting to senior hospital leadership. This was their first time engaging with such a formal process, and most had little prior experience in healthcare or with the VCU Health System. However, these presentations turned into an incredible networking opportunity for the students, as they had the chance to share their research findings and opportunity statements directly with hospital administrators and senior leaders. The feedback they received not only validated their work but also opened doors for future collaboration.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>At the end of the semester, we hosted a virtual demo day where students showcased their top ideas through engaging pitches. These presentations allowed students to demonstrate their creative thinking and problem-solving skills, leading to excitement from hospital staff about potential solutions moving forward.</p>

                                                <li><b>Teaching while being accountable for deliverables. </b> It was difficult relying on students for consistent and timely deliverables, especially since it was their first time engaging with this process, and many had no prior experience in healthcare or with the VCU Health System.</li>
                                                <li><b>Limited patient representation. </b>We were dependent on staff and provider engagement for collecting patient feedback, and despite our best efforts, we struggled to gain sufficient patient input to fully represent their experiences.</li>
                                                <li><b>Implementation schedule changes. </b>While implementation was descoped from this semester, we did see considerable reductions in patients leaving without being seen. The feedback from providers, staff, and leadership about improved team morale was highly positive.</li>

                                        <p>This project highlighted the power of empathy-driven, design thinking approaches to solving real-world healthcare challenges. It taught me valuable lessons in navigating resource constraints, fostering collaboration across teams, and using insights to advocate for meaningful change in healthcare. Even though we didn’t fully implement our solutions, the process brought fresh ideas, promoted communication, raised important issues for discussion, and improved morale among staff. By simply drawing more attention to the problem, we achieved real, measurable improvements in the number of patients leaving without being seen - an outcome that made this project a success in its own right.</p>

                                        <p>On a personal level, this project reinforced the power of design thinking to bring diverse perspectives together to solve complex problems. Working alongside students who had no prior experience in healthcare allowed me to refine my facilitation skills and think creatively about how to bridge gaps between research, real-world application, and systemic change.</p>
