In healthy aging, older adults often report changes in their rest-activity rhythms, for example, increased morningness preference, earlier wake times, increased sleep latency, and decreased total sleep time. These patterns can be assessed objectively using wrist-based accelerometers, or actigraphs. 

We analyzed multi-shell diffusion tensor images from 103 healthy young and older adults using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to examine relationships between white matter microstructure and rest-activity rhythm stability. Rest-activity rhythm measures were computed using both cosinor and non-parametric methods derived from seven days of accelerometer data. Because prior studies have suggested that the corpus callosum is sensitive to sleep physiology and rest-activity rhythm, we also conducted a focused region of interest analysis on the corpus callosum.

Greater rest-activity rhythm stability was associated with greater brain integrity across both young and older adults, primarily in the corpus callosum and anterior corona radiata. This effect was not moderated by age group. While rest-activity rhythm measures were associated with sleep metrics, rest-activity rhythm measures uniquely accounted for the variance in white matter integrity.

This study strengthens existing evidence for a relationship between brain white matter structure and rest-activity rhythm stability in the absence of health risk factors. While there are differences in rest-activity rhythm stability between age groups, the relationship with brain white matter was present across both young and older adults. Rest-activity rhythms may be a useful biomarker of brain health across both periods of adult development.
