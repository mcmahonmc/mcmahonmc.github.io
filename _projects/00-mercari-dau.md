# Reviving Engagement: The Quest for Daily Active Users

In 2023, the typical Mercari user opened Mercari once or twice a week. Of Mercari's 23M users, only about 80k were active daily. By comparison, we knew that the typical Mercari user in Japan accessed the app at least once daily, indicating that we had a large opportunity to improve engagement on the US app. But we didn't know where to begin.

# The Research Journey

## Decoding the Challenge

At the outset of the project we didn’t have a clear mission or specific goals for the driving engagement on Mercari. I set up 1:1 meetings with representatives from product management, marketing, and business intelligence to learn what they were hoping to get out of this research and what decisions they were hoping to make. 

Based on these interviews, it became clear that there two gaps in our current customer knowledge. We didn't understand why customers felt apathetic about Mercari. But we also didn't understand what brought some customers, our daily active users, back on a regular basis. 

I set about brainstorming research approaches for each direction, but ultimately decided to prioritize learning about our most engaged users. This would give us a clear understanding of our key differentiators, which we could use to form more specific hypotheses about what might be missing from the churned users' experiences before seeking to solicit data from a group that would be more difficult to recruit and potentially less reliable.

## Unifying Vision

After the 1:1 interviews, I hosted a research kickoff meeting, with members from product, marketing, engineering, and customer relationship management. I reviewed the study proposal, detailing the rationale for the direction I chose. I ensured alignment on the study design and timeline, and invited stakeholders to attend interview sessions as observers in the coming weeks.

## Early Insights

We first surveyed users who had shown frequent engagement with Mercari (access 60+ days and 13+ weeks over past 90 days). The results were analyzed by customer lifetime value and transactor type (buyer, seller, or both), to help us group findings by not only behavioral engagement but also by business value. I set a minimum sample size of 100 for each of the six segments.

The survey captured data about user motivations, what they find unique and enjoyable about Mercari, engagement with other apps, and demographics. It was later paired with interview data collected in the next study phase to contextualize qualitative findings.

## Diving Deeper: Exploring User Journeys Through A Diary Study

I chose a few survey respondents from each of the segments to participate in an in-depth, seven-day diary study. Participants were asked to document any interactions they had pertaining to resale as they went about their week. We weren't able to onboard a specific diary study tool in time, so I set up a scrappy version utilizing a combination of fixed daily surveys and flexible, at-will uploads to individual participant Google Drive folders.

At the conclusion of the diary study, I followed up with each of them in a 60 min 1:1 interview. Stakeholders were extended open invitations to observe any interviews they wished, with time for debriefing to follow each session.

## From Stories to Strategies

I used [EnjoyHQ](https://www.usertesting.com/platform/enjoyhq) to review, tag, and code interview transcripts and diary entries before affinity mapping by theme. I pulled key themes into highlight clips to help stakeholders connect more directly with user voices, then included these clips in the final share-out deck.

# Key Discoveries

## How Everyday Sellers Drive Engagement

I modeled the behaviors I observed from participants in the diary study using the Hook Model, which describes patterns of habit formation. This allowed us to visually map out the internal and external triggers that brought Mercari users back on a daily basis, the behaviors they took to follow through on those triggers, and the forms of investment that strengthened their likelihood of returning to Mercari in the future.

Through observations and interviews, I discovered that what this cycle of habit formation on Mercari among our most engaged users was the presence of everyday, casual, novice sellers, who create the experience of a variable reward. Everyday sellers take advantage of the simplicity of Mercari's listing form for ease of use. They may not know an item's market value, it's most relevant characteristics, or sometimes even, what an item is. Because Mercari is perceived as "beginner-friendly" these casual sellers list on our platform. For shoppers, they create variability in item desirability and availability, which drives the <b>thrill of the hunt</b>. This thrill is what creates a pattern of habit among Mercari's most engaged users - the treasure hunters and bargain thrifters. <br><br>

## Connecting Through Commerce: The Human Element of Mercari

From this study, we learned that our most engaged users loved being able to communicate with another everyday human on the other side of a transaction, as opposed to a bot, business, or foreigner. Our most engaged users also specifically mentioned they appreciate not needing to be “besties” or over-socialize on Mercari. They appreciate that interactions are purpose-driven and transaction-focused. 

This informed later directions for one of the company's major pillars, to facilitate community in a way that allows people to "geek out" with others around common interests. Because of this study, we intentionally steered towards decisions that brought us closer to a human experience of e-commerce, rather than toward a social network that minimized purposeful transactions.

# From Insight to Impact

I presented these insights to various audiences, including a product management offsite, an executive offsite, the UX team, and a company-wide show and tell. This research helped the organization focus its resources around key features that drive habit formation and helped crystallize our positioning to reflect what our most engaged users love best.
