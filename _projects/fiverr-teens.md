There are 32M teens in the US without an online marketplace that supports them in freelancing online. Fiverr wanted to explore how to strategically position themselves through marketing and product features in order to set teens and parents up for online freelancing success, and therefore expand their user base to a younger demographic.

Because minors cannot enter legally binding agreements, parental approval was key to our success. Through testing, we uncovered parents' priorities to enable teens to freelance safely and successfully through our platform.

## My Role
Led UX research support to identify how we might successfully encourage safe and successful teen freelancers, with enthusiastic permission and support from their parents.

*In-depth interviews • Competitor analysis • Desk research • UserZoom • FigJam • Reduct*

# Outcome
This research identified misalignment with short-term business goals, resulting in reduced resource allocation and risk. Should this direction be re-prioritized, this research generated 17+ actionable recommendations for product development and marketing.

# My Research Process

## Research Kickoff

We met as a team to discuss existing knowledge, identify challenges, and brainstorm research questions.

Challenges:
* Uncertain whether there is teen demand for a freelancing platform, but leadership was committed to launching in 6 mo.
* Legal had historically prohibited teen data collection, although we had some limited information from a prior age collection experiment.
* Research moderation tooling was nearing contractual deadline, with limited sampling capabilities.

## Study Plan

To develop the study plan, I focused initial stakeholder conversations around three main questions: 
* What decisions are we trying to make with research insights?
* What questions are most crucial to address?
* What questions are within our current and future capabilities to answer? What would we need in order to address these questions?

Because the company was bullish about this feature and were pushing an aggressive development timeline, we decided to pursue research on how parents navigated existing shared online account spaces, and what assurances they needed to feel comfortable with their teen freelancing online.

## Recruitment
We wanted to gather initial impressions from parents of teens who had never used Fiverr before, were comfortable with their teens performing some activities online, and passed attention checks. We segmented participants by whether they had heard of Fiverr before or not.

We debated how to factor prior freelancing experience into our sample selection criteria. There was appetite to hear from parents with no prior freelancing experience, however, I speculated that that was perhaps a smaller audience than stakeholders expected. We elected not to set a criteria here to refrain from being overly selective in our sample. However, I made it clear that this was not a way to gather representative data and we should consider future testing with adequate sample size (8-10) representing each segment.  

## Parent Interviews

Through UserZoom (now [UserTesting](https://www.usertesting.com/platform/userzoom)), I interviewed 8 parents of teens 13-17 about how they navigate online social and business transactions with their teen. Only one parent had zero prior freelancing experience. We also performed a sorting activity to clarify default teen account permissions. 

I used [Reduct](https://reduct.video/product/edit-video) to review, tag, and code interview transcripts before affinity mapping by theme. I pulled key themes into highlight reels to help stakeholders connect more directly with user voices, then included these reels in the final share-out deck.

## Desk Research

I researched the examples of shared account spaces that parents mentioned during interviews, gathering themes about parent account structures communication, positioning, and features, to kick-start design ideation.

## Report

In the report, I summarized the key findings from parent interviews, the permissions sorting activity, and my desk research. When I presented these findings to our UX and Brand team, I shared video highlight reels, letting parents speak for themselves. Then I opened up the floor to the audience with the question, "What themes do you notice?" This drew out many of the key themes I discussed later on in the presentation, but also highlighted a few details I hadn't considered.

# Key Takeaways
Ultimately, we learned that parents would need assurances about content moderation, user verification, supervision capabilities, and transactional permissions in order to feel comfortable allowing their teens to create an independent account. Most parents did not perceive account creation on their teen's behalf as a blocker, so based on the feature value alone, we did not expect to see a significant lift in teen adoption.

However, some parents saw Fiverr as a potential opportunity for teens to learn valuable business skills with parental guidance. All parents emphasized the importance of teen education about financial transactions and online safety before starting to freelance independently online. If we invested significant resources to address this desire for parents, by providing teen financial and business education, showing examples of successful teens, and finding ways to signal teen credibility to parents and other users, feature adoption was likely to be much more successful.

# Research Impact
I shared my report with product leadership and design team to
inform scoping estimations and inform feature specifications. Because of this research, we uncovered that the likely outcome was in conflict with other business priorities, so the feature was not pursued.

If this direction is re-prioritized, this research generated 17 recommendations to help the design and marketing teams pick up quickly with an understanding of how to configure default teen permissions, make a positive first impressions on parents, differentiate through positioning as a teen learning experience, and build attractive parental controls features.
