The typical Mercari user opens Mercari once or twice a week. But Mercari Japan users access the app at least once daily. This indicated that we had a huge opportunity to drive engagement on our platform. Yet - how to do that?

## My Role
I led research from project intake, study conceptualization, facilitation, analysis, and reporting. 

*Surveys • Diary study • Interviews • Sprig • EnjoyHQ*

# My Research Process

## Stakeholder Interviews

I knew this project had high potential to have widespread influence, so I wanted to make sure that it was going to deliver in accordance with stakeholder expectations. I set up 1:1 meetings with representatives from product management, marketing, and data science to learn what they were hoping to get out of this research and what decisions they were hoping to make. 

Based on these interviews, it became clear that there two gaps in our current customer knowledge. We didn't understand why customers churned. But we also didn't understand what brought customers back on a regular basis. I set about brainstorming research approaches for each direction, but ultimately decided to prioritize learning about our most engaged users. This would give us a clear understanding of our key differentiators, which we could use to form more specific hypotheses about what might be missing from the churned users' experiences before seeking to solicit data from a group that would be more difficult to recruit and potentially less reliable.

## Research Kickoff

After the 1:1 interviews, I hosted a research kickoff meeting, with members from product, marketing, engineering, and customer relationship management. I reviewed the study proposal, detailing the rationale for the direction I chose. I ensured alignment on the study design and timeline, and invited stakeholders to attend interview sessions as observers in the coming weeks.

## Survey

We surveyed users who had shown frequent engagement with Mercari (access 60+ days and 13+ weeks over past 90 days). The results were analyzed by customer lifetime value and transactor type (buyer, seller, or both), to help us group findings by not only behavioral engagement but also by business value. I set a minimum sample size of 100 for each of the six segments.

The survey captured data about user motivations, what they find unique and enjoyable about Mercari, engagement with other apps, and demographics.

## Diary Study

I chose a few survey respondents from each of the segments to participate in an in-depth, seven-day diary study. Participants were asked to document any interactions they had pertaining to resale as they went about their week. We weren't able to onboard a specific diary study tool in time, so I set up a scrappy version utilizing a combination of fixed daily surveys and flexible, at-will uploads to individual participant Google Drive folders.

At the conclusion of the diary study, I followed up with each of them in a 60 min 1:1 interview. Stakeholders were extended open invitations to observe any interviews they wished, with time for debriefing to follow each session.

## Analysis

I used [EnjoyHQ](https://www.usertesting.com/platform/enjoyhq) to review, tag, and code interview transcripts and diary entries before affinity mapping by theme. I pulled key themes into highlight clips to help stakeholders connect more directly with user voices, then included these clips in the final share-out deck.

# Key Takeaways

* __What do people want?__ The predominant motivations on Mercari are (1) to make money and (2) to find deals. Across segments, promoting sustainability seemed to resonate more so with overlappers and sellers, and customers with lower lifetime value tended to have more reasons for using Mercari.

* __What separates us from the pack?__ Our focus on simplicity, and our unique features: offers, ratings, and saved search. These create the perception that Mercari is trustworthy and transparent. Search helps people create a curated experience to find exactly what interests them, especially when the item is otherwise hard to find.

* __What do our users most value?__ Our community is created through the ability to communicate directly with friendly, reasonable, and honest sellers. People love being able to communicate with another everyday human on the other side of a transaction. Several specifically mentioned they appreciate not needing to be “besties” or over-socialize on Mercari. They appreciate that interactions are purpose-driven and transaction-focused.

# Research Impact

## DAU Study On Tour

I presented this study so many times that it started to feel a little bit like I was on tour! First, I shared this report at a product leadership offsite. Managers jotted down questions and ideas as I presented, then grouped them into themes on a whiteboard and used this to drive discussions and decision-making over the coming days. Ultimately, 6/10 of the recommendations coming out of this project were prioritized for immediate execution in the upcoming product roadmap.

> Your delivery was polished and influential; the takeaways you impressed upon the team were the most referenced data for the remainder of the workshop.

I was then asked to present this study, in combination with other converging findings from a separate project, at Mercari's executive offsite. This generated much discussion about which customer segment to focus our efforts on supporting, and ultimately the decision aligned with the study's recommendation to continue supporting our everyday, amateur sellers. This report helped leadership to orient around a specific customer segment, and was cited in the company and product all hands meetings at the beginning of the next fiscal year. 

Finally, I also presented this research to our UX & Brand Team as well as at a company-wide "Show and Tell" to help socialize these insights more broadly. The wider team really appreciated the opportunity to connect with customers, an observation which later drove me to initiate our quarterly Research Lunch & Learn which was attended by 70+ employees.

## Positioning

Because of this study, we were able to better align our marketing and product initiatives to emphasize our key differentiators that resonate most with people who are "hooked" on Mercari.

Comparing App Store screenshots from March 2023, just before this study was completed, to 2024, we can see some important changes:
1. Luxury and bulky inventory no longer are featured prominently. Instead, today Mercari features inventory related to niche interests, like BTS, and highlights how valued features like saved search help Mercari users stay up to date with the latest items. 
2. It emphasizes finding deals through offers, beloved by our daily users. 
3. Mercari calls out the ratings system as a way to build trust, rather than buyer protection, which was not something universally favored by our buyers. 

Altogether, this research helped Mercari understand what's most important to the people who love Mercari so that we know what to emphasize and optimize to continue bringing them back.
