# Revolutionizing Rest-Activity Rhythm Assessment with Wearable Tech

This research examined the instrumental validity of Fitbits for capturing human sleep and activity rhythms in order to promote well-being and trust in a self-service mobile app for community members participating in UT research. While commercial wearable activity bands are increasingly boasting sleep assessment capabilities, studies comparing these bands to previously validated devices are sparse. In one of three of my dissertation studies, I analyzed sleep and 24-hr activity rhythm measures obtained from Fitbit and Actiwatch 2.0 activity bands simultaneously worn by young and older adults. I examined the inter-device agreement for each of the selected measures to understand how well Fitbits capture these properties relative to the laboratory-grade device.

# Leading Comprehensive Research Efforts

I conducted this research as one of three dissertation studies. I led research design, study implementation, analyses, and publication preparation.

*Time-series analysis • Activity monitoring • Sleep diary • Surveys • Qualtrics*

# Groundbreaking Findings on Wearable Validity

Relative to the Actiwatch, which for purposes of this study were considered “ground truth”, we found that Fitbits provided biased and inconsistent nightly estimates for total sleep time and time in bed but showed strong agreement for capturing the majority of global rest- activity measures, including rhythm amplitude, acrophase, and relative amplitude. These re- sults suggest that Fitbits show strong instrumental validity for capturing 24-hr activity patterns, which opens up new opportunities for active monitoring of age-related 24-hr activity changes and scalable 24-hr activity rhythm research.

These new insights helped drive the decision to include Fitbit activity data acquisition in the launch of a major 5-year cohort study under the direction of the Whole Communities Whole Health. Participants will be able to see their activity data (which showed high instrumental validity, as opposed to the sleep data) and how that relates to other environmental variables through the app.

This research is now published [Smart Health, 29 (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352648323000466).

# The Research Journey

## Meticulous Design for Valid Data Collection

We enrolled over 50 healthy participants ages 18-74 who simultaneously wore a Fitbit and a lab-grade Actiwatch on opposite wrists for 10-14 days. Actiwatch arm assignment was randomized across participants. 

### Engaging Over 50 Participants Across Age Groups Amidst a Pandemic

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred following the initial wave of young adult data collection. We eventually resumed the study with a fully remote, contactless procedure. I packaged up the study equipment in plastic shoe boxes and drove all over Austin and the surrounding area to deliver the equipment at participants' doorsteps. When participants needed to troubleshoot device setup, we arranged to meet over video calls. 

## Activity Tracking: Advanced Techniques for 24-Hour Rhythm Analysis

We collected summary sleep statistics (sleep duration, time in bed) from each device. We also used raw step-count and activity data to calculate novel measures that reflect aspects of the 24-hour activity rhythm (or circadian rhythm). These measures can be calculated using parametric techniques, which involve fitting the activity data to a modified cosinor curve, or non-parametric techniques, which involve using central tendency measures across various time window chosen to represent more or less active periods in relation to one another.

To measure agreement between devices, I created Bland-Altman plots, which diagram the difference between two measurements on the y-axis and the average of the two measurements on the x-axis. I then created visuals that summarized the findings for each measure of interest to help understand the instrumental validity of Fitbits for sleep assessment at a higher level.

## Surveys: Capturing Daily Habits and Moods

We used a combination of Qualtrics (above) and REDCap daily surveys to collect information about participants’ sleep, activity, and social habits, as well as their daily moods.

# Key Insights

## Unearthing Fitbit's Strengths and Quirks

We observed large discrepancies across devices in sleep time, time in bed, and the 24-hr activity model’s minimum, which reflects the amount of restlessness during sleep. However, there was excellent agreement across the other 24-hr activity rhythm measures.

## Associations with Psychological Well-Being

Using the daily survey data, we found that 24-hour activity rhythm measures were associated with multiple measures of psychological well-being, including happiness, sadness, rumination, and stress. These effects were weak to moderate, depending on the measure examined.

# Research Impact

## Integrating Fitbit Data into the Whole Communities Whole Health Initiative

This project helped drive the decision to include Fitbit activity data acquisition in the launch of a major 5-year cohort study under the direction of the Whole Communities Whole Health.

## Empowering Participants with Real-Time Data

Through this study, families can choose to have access to technology that will measure health factors like indoor air quality, sleep habits, mood, or physical activity. Their data is shared with them in real-time through a smartphone app so they can make informed decisions about their own health.

This validation work strengthened the decision to include Fitbit data collection as part of the study. Participants will be able to see their activity data (which showed high instrumental validity, as opposed to the sleep data) and how that relates to other environmental variables through the app.

## Driving Health Improvements in the Community 

This data is also used in aggregated formats by community partners to advocate for changes at the city and county level to improve issues affecting the health of the entire community.

This work helped to articulate the value of including sleep and activity data to inform community advocacy efforts.
