The [Science Museum of Virginia](https://smv.org) captivates hundreds of thousands of guests each year through experiential exhibits, unique artifacts, interactive technologies, innovative workshops, dynamic films, impressive live animals, hands-on makerspaces, interesting lab demos, and quirky original content. 

I participated in a 2-hour workshop hosted by the [Richmond Design Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rvadsgn/), during which we conducted a heuristic analysis of the in-person Science Museum experience.

## My Role
I participated in a workshop together with my team, where we each adopted the mindset of one of the science museum's key customers: a teacher, grandparent or parent, and a child. As we made our way through the museum, we took note of these museum goers' experiences using the 5 E's of the customer journey framework.

# Our Research Process

## Personas

As design thinkers, we know it's important to always put ourselves in the shoes of our  customers. Who may visit the Science Museum of Virginia? What are their unique motivations and needs? We discussed this as a group, and came up with a handful of key customer segments. I later fleshed these out as lo-fi personas to help us undersatnd guests' needs, wants, and pain points. These personas were used to ground us in the mindsets of each of these types of guests as we completed the heuristic evaluation exercise.

## Customer Journey Mapping 

We discussed the 5 E's framework to guide our thinking on how we might identify touchpoints and potential problems. We considered how customers might engage, enquire, explore, explain, and evaluate their expereiences with the Science Museum. 

We spent the next few hours at the museum, observing visitor behavior and evaluating the experience. I adopted the mindset of "Grandpa Gus" imagining how he might think and feel as he made his way through his Science Museum experience. I mapped Gus' emotions at each stage of the customer journey represented by a color-coded dot to represent the overall picture of his emotional experience.

It quickly became evident that there was a huge opportunity to improve wayfinding. As a previous museum volunteer, there were multiple occassions when I offered to lead the group to various exhibits. Without me there to shepherd them, we would not have known how to make the most of our museum experience in the short time we had.

## Heuristic evaluation

Together we conducted an evaluation using established usability heuristics, or principles for designing user-friendly interfaces.

Again adopting the mindset of Gus the Grandpa and each of the other key segments, I documented instances where these heuristics were violated.

# Reflection

The 2-hour workshop hosted by the [Richmond Design Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rvadsgn/), focusing on the Virginia Science Museum, was a valuable and insightful experience. Collaborating with fellow UX professionals on a heuristic evaluation and customer journey map provided a rich understanding of the museum's visitor experience.

## Key Learnings:

* __Heuristic Evaluation Power:__ The heuristic evaluation process highlighted common usability issues faced by grandparents, such as complex language, inaccessible displays, and lack of senior-friendly resources. This emphasizes the importance of designing for diverse user needs and abilities.
* __Benefits of Journey Mapping:__ Creating a journey map from the perspective of a grandparent like "Grandpa Gus" illuminated the emotional highs and lows encountered throughout their visit. This helps us prioritize improvements that address potential frustrations and enhance overall satisfaction.
* __Collaboration is Key:__ Working alongside other UX professionals fostered a diverse range of perspectives. Sharing knowledge and experiences led to a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities at the Virginia Science Museum.
