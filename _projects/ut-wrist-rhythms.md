This research examined the instrumental validity of Fitbits for capturing human sleep and activity rhythms in order to promote well-being and trust in a self-service mobile app for community members participating in UT research.

# My Role

I conducted this research as one of three dissertation studies. I led research design, study implementation, analyses, and publication preparation.

*Time-series analysis • Activity monitoring • Sleep diary • Surveys • Qualtrics*

# Outcomes
Many aspects of activity rhythms, but not nightly sleep, were captured accurately by the Fitbit relative to a research-grade activity tracking device. Further, these activity rhythm measures were associated with multiple measures of psychological well-being, including happiness, sadness, rumination, and stress. These effects were weak to moderate, depending on the measure examined.

These new insights helped drive the decision to include Fitbit activity data acquisition in the launch of a major 5-year cohort study under the direction of the Whole Communities Whole Health. Participants will be able to see their activity data (which showed high instrumental validity, as opposed to the sleep data) and how that relates to other environmental variables through the app.

This research is now published [Smart Health, 29 (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352648323000466).

# My Research Process

## Study Plan

We enrolled over 50 healthy participants ages 18-74 who simultaneously wore a Fitbit and a lab-grade Actiwatch on opposite wrists for 10-14 days. Actiwatch arm assignment was randomized across participants.

## Activity Tracking

We collected summary sleep statistics (sleep duration, time in bed) from each device. We also used raw step-count and activity data to calculate novel measures that reflect aspects of the 24-hour activity rhythm (or circadian rhythm).

## Surveys

We used a combination of Qualtrics (above) and REDCap daily surveys to collect information about participants’ sleep, activity, and social habits, as well as their daily moods.

# Key Takeaways

## Activity measure agreement

After conducting a Bland-Altman analysis, I created visuals that summarized the findings for each measure of interest to help understand the instrumental validity of Fitbits for sleep assessment at a higher level.These data showed large discrepancies across devices in sleep time, time in bed, and the circadian model’s minimum, which reflects the amount of restlessness during sleep. However, there was excellent agreement across the other circadian rhythm measures.

Beyond knowing that Fitbit can accurately capture 24-hour activity rhythm measures, why are these measures potentially important for Fitbit users?

## Associations with well-being

Using the daily survey data, we found that 24-hour activity rhythm measures were associated with multiple measures of psychological well-being, including happiness, sadness, rumination, and stress. These effects were weak to moderate, depending on the measure examined.

# Research Impact

This project helped drive the decision to include Fitbit activity data acquisition in the launch of a major 5-year cohort study under the direction of the Whole Communities Whole Health.

## Personalized insights

Through this study, families can choose to have access to technology that will measure health factors like indoor air quality, sleep habits, mood, or physical activity. Their data is shared with them in real-time through a smartphone app so they can make informed decisions about their own health.

This validation work strengthened the decision to include Fitbit data collection as part of the study. Participants will be able to see their activity data (which showed high instrumental validity, as opposed to the sleep data) and how that relates to other environmental variables through the app.

## Community advocacy

This data is also used in aggregated formats by community partners to advocate for changes at the city and county level to improve issues affecting the health of the entire community.

This work helped to articulate the value of including sleep and activity data to inform community advocacy efforts.
