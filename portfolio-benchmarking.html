                                        <h2>Overview</h2>

                                        <p><a href="https://www.mercari.com/about/" target="_blank">Mercari</a> was set to roll out three major product features in 2023, but the team lacked a structured approach to monitor long-term user experience (UX) and business performance. To address this, I led the development of a comprehensive benchmarking system to track changes in UX metrics over time, using surveys, stakeholder insights, and Looker dashboards. This system allowed for ongoing tracking of ease of use, navigation, and core functionality, empowering teams to make data-driven decisions.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

                                        <p>As Mercari prepared for a series of bold product releases, there was no reliable way to measure how these changes affected the UX and business performance over time. This lack of benchmarking left teams unable to track user satisfaction or functionality over product iterations, putting the company at risk of making uninformed decisions.</p>

                                        <h2>Approach</h2>

                                        <p>I approached this challenge by developing a multi-faceted system that incorporated both UX research and business intelligence. I began with extensive desk research to understand internal and external benchmarking approaches. Then, I audited existing resources to identify limitations and potential channels for recruitment, culminating in a comprehensive roadmap for the benchmarking system.</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b>Stakeholder Collaboration. </b>I gathered input from product managers, UX leaders, and data engineers to co-create a recruitment plan and survey content. By collaborating with cross-functional teams, I ensured that the resulting data would meet the needs of all key stakeholders.</li>
                                            <li><b>Building the System. </b>The system was designed to gather data across multiple sources, including live intercept surveys from app users, combined with data from Mercari's internal systems. I worked closely with the data engineering team to set up Looker dashboards, ensuring seamless integration of real-time data for ease of access.</li>
                                            <li><b>Survey Development and Pilot Launch. </b>I developed user surveys targeting ease of use, navigation, and core functionality. These surveys were deployed quarterly, with the first pilot launched in May 2023. To maximize engagement, we offered sweepstakes incentives, a first for Mercari.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h2>Execution & Impact</h2>

                                        <p>Through this benchmarking system, we identified and addressed key pain points in Mercari’s search functionality, driving a +13% increase in order volume for previously underperforming categories. Additionally, the system’s dashboard made UX insights accessible across the organization, fostering collaboration and enabling data-driven decision-making.

                                            <br><br>The research also empowered growth in analytics expertise across the team. I led Looker training sessions and hosted office hours, helping the team develop a deeper understanding of user data and the tools they needed to improve Mercari's performance.</p>
                                        
                                        <h2>Reflection & Learnings</h2>

                                        <p>The complexity of integrating multiple data sources and aligning stakeholders across functions was one of the biggest challenges. My approach to facilitating collaboration and keeping the system accessible played a key role in overcoming these obstacles. The system has now been adopted as a long-term strategy for tracking UX metrics.</p>
                                            
                                        <h2>Outcome</h2>

                                        <p>This project resulted in a scalable framework for tracking UX metrics that is still in use today. It continues to drive Mercari’s product iterations by identifying pain points and long-term trends, empowering teams to make impactful changes based on real user feedback.</p>
                                        
                                            
                                            The results were analyzed by customer lifetime value and transactor type (buyer, seller, or both), to help us group findings by not only behavioral engagement but also by business value. I set a minimum sample size of 100 for each of the six segments.
                                            
                                            The survey captured data about user motivations, what they find unique and enjoyable about Mercari, engagement with other apps, and demographics.
                                            
                                            We later conducted a second survey, segmented by generations.
