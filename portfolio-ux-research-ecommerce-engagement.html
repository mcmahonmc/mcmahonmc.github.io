                                <h1>Enhancing User Engagement on Mercari's Ecommerce Platform</h1>

                                <p>When Mercari faced a significant engagement challenge in its U.S. market, I led a research initiative to uncover what drove highly active users to engage with the platform. Using methods like surveys, diary studies, and in-depth interviews, I explored user behaviors and motivations, segmenting participants to identify key drivers of engagement. Applying behavioral frameworks like the Hook Model, I uncovered opportunities to enhance casual selling, trust-building mechanisms, and the emotional connections users found in thoughtful interactions. These insights directly shaped product and marketing strategies, including the introduction of "Lite Listing," improved ratings tools, and campaigns that highlighted the thrill of deal-finding. Through this project, I learned to overcome resource limitations, align cross-functional teams, and champion the user at every level of the organization.</p>

                                        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

                                        <p>In 2023, Mercari faced a critical challenge: U.S. users engaged with the platform just 1-2 times per week, far less frequently than the daily activity observed in Japan. With only 80,000 daily active users in the U.S., increasing engagement became essential. As the lead researcher, I spearheaded efforts to uncover actionable insights about Mercari’s most engaged U.S. users and translate those findings into strategies for growth.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2>The Research Process</h2>

                                        <p>To begin, I worked with the business insights and data science teams to align on criteria for identifying a segment of highly active users—those who remained engaged for over 60 days within a quarter—through surveys that segmented them by lifetime value and role as either buyers or sellers. These surveys captured data on user motivations, unique platform features, engagement with other apps, and demographic profiles, providing a comprehensive view of user behavior. Building on these insights, I conducted a week-long diary study in which participants documented their resale interactions, supplemented by daily surveys and uploads to individual Google Drive folders. At the study’s conclusion, I conducted in-depth, one-on-one interviews to contextualize behaviors and motivations. By using tools like EnjoyHQ for synthesis and affinity mapping, I distilled these findings into actionable themes, supported by user highlight reels to bring their voices into focus for stakeholders.</p>

                                        <h2>Key Insights</h2>

                                        <p>The research revealed three key insights. First, casual sellers, who listed items infrequently, created a sense of excitement, particularly when pricing errors led to unexpectedly good deals. Features like saved searches enhanced this dynamic, fostering a “treasure hunt” experience. Second, meaningful commerce-driven connections resonated more with users than traditional social networking features. Thoughtful gestures, such as thank-you notes, built trust and loyalty, strengthening the emotional value of interactions. Finally, reputation-building mechanisms, like ratings and messaging, became emotional anchors, transforming functional tools into essential engagement drivers.</p>

                                        <p>I modeled the behaviors I observed from participants in the diary study using the Hook Model of Habit Formation. The Hook Model helped identify key moments to deepen user engagement by fostering habitual interactions. By analyzing triggers, actions, rewards, and investments in the user journey, we pinpointed opportunities like targeted notifications to prompt re-engagement, variable rewards that amplified the thrill of finding deals, and reputation-building actions that encouraged repeat use. These behavioral loops turned occasional visits into habits, driving sustained growth.</p>

                                        <p>These insights directly influenced Mercari’s U.S. strategy. Following cross-functional ideation workshops, product changes included the introduction of "Lite Listing" for casual sellers, enhanced ratings tools to build trust, and community hashtags to connect niche interest groups. Marketing strategies shifted to emphasize the thrill of deal-finding, the trustworthiness of ratings, and the appeal of everyday inventory. Leadership adopted a user-behavior-focused approach, moving away from demographic assumptions to prioritize the "jobs to be done" by their users.</p>

                                        <p>Updates like saved searches drove measurable increases in engagement, marketing campaigns resonated more deeply with user priorities, and leadership aligned around a unified vision rooted in empathy. Cross-functional teams connected with user stories, creating a culture of innovation and understanding.</p>

                                        <p>This project was more than a research study—it was a lesson in the power of user-centered design to drive strategic transformation. It taught me how to navigate resource constraints, rally cross-functional teams, and advocate for the user at every level. Ultimately, it wasn’t just about engagement metrics—it was about creating a platform that resonates with the people who use it.</p>
