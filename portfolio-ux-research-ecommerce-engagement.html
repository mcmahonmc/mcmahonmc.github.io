                                        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

                                        <p>In 2023, Mercari faced a unique conundrum: while its Japanese user base logged in daily, its 23 million U.S. users averaged only one or two sessions a week. This disparity wasn’t just a metric—it was a wake-up call. With only 80,000 daily active users in the U.S., Mercari’s potential for engagement was falling short. The task was clear: discover what drives deeper connections for U.S. users and turn insights into impactful changes.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2>My Role</h2>

                                        <p>As the lead researcher on this project, I set out to uncover the habits, motivations, and needs of Mercari’s most active U.S. users. By combining data analysis, user storytelling, and strategic collaboration, I aimed to align Mercari’s marketing and product development with the heart of its community. I didn’t just want to study the “secondhand superstars”—I wanted to unite cross-functional teams across the company around our most engaged customers' needs.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2>The Research Process</h2>

                                        <h3>Finding the Stars</h3>
                                        <p>The first step was to identify the most engaged users—those active for 60+ days in the past quarter—and understand who they were. Through surveys, we segmented them by lifetime value and whether they were buyers, sellers, or both. These surveys revealed more than numbers; they surfaced patterns of behavior, motivations, and frustrations.</p>

                                        <h3>A Week in Their Shoes</h3>
                                        <p>To dig deeper, I designed a diary study. For seven days, selected participants documented their every resale-related interaction. The setup was intentionally lean—a simple system of Google Drive and daily surveys—but the insights were profound. From snapping photos of transactions to reflecting on their motivations, participants painted a vivid picture of their experiences.</p>
                                        
                                        <h3>Voices Behind the Clicks</h3>
                                        <p>The diaries led to 60-minute follow-up interviews. These conversations, open to stakeholder observation, became pivotal moments for alignment. Through them, we uncovered the “why” behind the “what,” transforming data points into human stories.</p>
                                        
                                        <h3>Synthesizing the Story</h3>
                                        <p>Using EnjoyHQ and affinity mapping, I coded themes, identified patterns, and built highlight reels that amplified user voices. These weren’t just findings—they were a call to action.</p>

                                        <h3>Everyday Sellers Create Everyday Magic</h3>
                                        <p><b>"What I love about Mercari is the naivete"</b><br>The majority of the platform's sellers weren’t professionals—they were casual users listing items for fun or extra cash. Their occasional pricing mistakes created a “thrill of the hunt” for buyers, fueling engagement. Features like saved searches and offers were crucial enablers.</p>

                                        <h3>Purposeful Connections Matter</h3>
                                        <p><b>“I don’t want to feel like I have to be besties with everyone on the internet”</b><br>Users weren’t looking for a social network; they wanted meaningful, commerce-driven interactions. Thoughtful touches, like thank-you notes in packages, added authenticity and trust. This was a difficult finding to deliver given a strong organizational push to incorporate more social features.</p>
                                        
                                        <h3>Reputation Reinforces Engagement</h3>
                                        <p>In addition to the thrill of the hunt or the rush of a sale, for both buyers and sellers, ratings and messages weren’t just functional—they were relational. These tools built trust, reinforced by small gestures of gratitude.</p>

                                            <p>Megan led one of the most important studies in the product team’s history, helping us understand who our core user base is, what their motivations are and what their key pain points are. This study is still essential to how we think about our customer base and product today.</p>

                                        <p>This project was more than a research study—it was a lesson in the power of user-centered design to drive strategic transformation. It taught me how to navigate resource constraints, rally cross-functional teams, and advocate for the user at every level. Ultimately, it wasn’t just about engagement metrics—it was about creating a platform that resonates with the people who use it.</p>
