                                        <h2>Overview</h2>

                                        <p><a href="https://www.mercari.com/about/" target="_blank">Mercari</a>’s mission is to connect millions of people across the U.S. to shop and sell almost anything. In 2023, the typical Mercari user opened Mercari once or twice a week. Of Mercari’s 23M users, only about 80k were active daily. By comparison, we knew that the typical Mercari user in Japan accessed the app at least once daily, indicating that we had a large opportunity to improve engagement on the US app. But we didn’t know where to begin.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

                                        <p>We needed to understand the drivers of repeat engagement on Mercari. So, I led a foundational research study that helped align our marketing and product initiatives to emphasize our key differentiators that resonate most with Mercari’s “secondhand superstars.”
                                        </p>

                                        <h2>My Role</h2>

                                        <p>I led research focusing on understanding the behaviors, attitudes, and barriers that influenced user interactions with the platform. My responsibilities included conducting user interviews, designing and implementing surveys, analyzing platform data, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to turn insights into actionable improvements.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2>Outcome</h2>

                                        <p><b>Blueprinted decision-making discussions to create the 2023 product roadmap, and drove changes in positioning strategy, focusing on drivers of engagement.</b> This research focused our organizational strategy on features identified through this study as drivers of habit formation, that ultimately led to an increased engagement measured as a ratio of daily to monthly active users.</p>

                                                    <br>This research shaped how we thought about fostering connection across Mercari users. Here, the redesigned home features communities, which allow users to more easily find items that align with their interests through hashtags and keeps the social focus around items, not "internet besties".

                                                    <br>In the AppStore, we strategically updated our positioning to reflect the needs of our most engaged users. For example, we removed depictions of luxury and bulky inventory; emphasized finding deals through offers, which was found to be a key trigger for habit formation; and highlighted the ratings system as a way to build trust, rather than buyer protection which had more mixed reception.

                                        <h2>Approach</h2>

                                        <h3>Iterative surveys</h3>
                                        <p>We surveyed users who had shown frequent engagement with Mercari (access 60+ days and 13+ weeks over past 90 days). 

                                            The results were analyzed by customer lifetime value and transactor type (buyer, seller, or both), to help us group findings by not only behavioral engagement but also by business value. I set a minimum sample size of 100 for each of the six segments.
                                            
                                            The survey captured data about user motivations, what they find unique and enjoyable about Mercari, engagement with other apps, and demographics.
                                            
                                            We later conducted a second survey, segmented by generations.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>Diving deeper</h3>
                                        <p>I chose a few survey respondents from each of the segments to participate in an in-depth, seven-day diary study. Participants were asked to document any interactions they had pertaining to resale as they went about their week. 

                                            We weren’t able to onboard a specific diary study tool in time, so I set up a scrappy version utilizing a combination of fixed daily surveys and flexible, at-will uploads to individual participant Google Drive folders.
                                            
                                            At the conclusion of the diary study, I followed up with each of them in a 60 min 1:1 interview. Stakeholders were extended open invitations to observe any interviews they wished, with time for debriefing to follow each session.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Through observation, we learned that novice and casual sellers are driving "secondhand superstar" engagement. Casual sellers are critical to being able to make the most of Mercari because they create the experience of variable reward.</p>

                                        <p>We learned that our most engaged users loved being able to communicate with another everyday human on the other side of a transaction, as opposed to a bot, business, or foreigner. Our most engaged users also specifically mentioned they appreciate not needing to be “besties” or over-socialize on Mercari. They appreciate that interactions are purpose-driven and transaction-focused.</p>

                                        <h2>Reflection</h2>

                                        <p> There were definitely a few of the head scratchers for me on this project:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><b>Regression to the mean. </b>Since we’re interested in our most engaged users, how do we ensure the measured behavior is real and sustained? While statistical thinking centers around the central limit theorem, in design thinking we actually want to engage with extreme users to inspire more fruitful ideation.</li>
                                                <li><b>Performance anxiety. </b>How do we account for changes participants make in their behaviors as a consequence of knowingly being observed, or the Hawthorne effect? I created a Looker dashboard to analyze diary study participants' app interactions during the diary study and the week prior.</li>
                                                <li><b>Accessibility. </b>How can we accommodate varying levels of familiarity with technology to ensure data integrity across participants? We didn't have budget for diary study software, so I created a scrappy, accessible workaround using Google Drive and our in-app survey platform, Sprig.</li>
                                                <li><b>Analysis and Tooling. </b>How will I set up a feasible system for data collection that compiles information across various sources? I used tools like EnjoyHQ, Miro, R, and Looker to streamline my analyses to the extent possible. </li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>

                                                <li><b>Clarified positioning. </b>Because of this study, we were able to better align our marketing and product initiatives to emphasize our key differentiators.</li>
                                                <li><b>Shaped executive conversations. </b>This study prompted executives to question assumptions based on demographics , instead orienting around customer jobs to be done.</li>
                                                <li><b>Inspired customer connection. </b>Employees across the company, from UX to finance, marketing to CRM, had the opportunity to hear customer voices.</li>
